  <p>As a software engineering student, I love the beauty of tech, but I&rsquo;m also afraid of it.</p>
<p>Technologies help us a lot in every aspect of life. But it also brings a data hunger from big tech companies.</p>
<p>But there is always a solution. You can get more privacy, so big companies can&rsquo;t have information about you, or they have at least.</p>
<h2 id="web-browser">Web-browser</h2>
<p>You can opt out of Google Chrome by using <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://ungoogled-software.github.io/">Ungoogled-chromium</a>, I have a <a href="/blog/browsers-for-daily-using/">detailed review</a>.</p>
<p>You have to separate your activities. Creating multiple profiles for multiple purposes is a good idea.</p>
<h2 id="email">Email</h2>
<p>I know that a lot of universities give Gmail accounts to their students. It&rsquo;s an easy way for them.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t switch email services when using school email, but you can choose an alternative for personal purposes.</p>
<p>You can check out <a href="https://tuta.com/">Tuta</a>, <a href="https://proton.me/">Proton</a>, <a href="https://skiff.com/">Skiff</a>.
They have an easy way to register.</p>
<p>If you want to have PGP by yourself, I strongly recommend it. You may look at <a href="https://disroot.org/">Disroot</a>, <a href="https://cock.li/">Cock.li</a>, <a href="https://www.autistici.org/">Autistici</a>, or even G-Mail with <a href="https://mailvelope.com/">Mailvelope</a></p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://digdeeper.club/articles/email.xhtml">E-mail providers - which one to choose?</a> article from DigDeeper which can give you reviews and a lot of suggestions.</p>
<p>You have to notice that you <strong>never</strong> use school email for personal work, creating accounts,&hellip;
It&rsquo;s something about privacy and security:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some schools block emails outside the organization.</li>
<li>They can delete your email accounts when you leave the university.</li>
<li>An administrator can easily reset the password.</li>
<li>They can gain unauthorized access to your email account.</li>
</ol>
<p>But you can choose the <em><strong>TrustNoOne</strong></em> plan by encrypting your email manually using PGP. The software you can use is <a href="https://gnupg.org/">The GNU Privacy Guard</a>.</p>
<p>An email client would be nice: <a href="https://www.claws-mail.org/">Claws Mail</a>, <a href="https://neomutt.org/">NeoMutt</a>, and <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">ThunderBird</a> (which should be hardened for privacy concerns). Email clients will help you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the program you like. Not depending on the provider&rsquo;s JavaScript.</li>
<li>The mail client will remain constant. Prevent being served malicious JavaScript.</li>
<li>POP3 allows you to keep control of your data in your hands.</li>
<li>The variety of features.</li>
<li>Support PGP properly.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="real-time-messaging">Real-time messaging</h2>
<p>Although Facebook Messenger, Viber, and WhatsApp come with a lot of features. But they are data-hungers, no matter how encrypted they are.
Those encryptions can only protect you from attackers, not from those companies.</p>
<p>You can switch to <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>, it&rsquo;s an encrypted messaging platform that has a good reputation, doesn&rsquo;t store your messages, and is very easy to use.</p>
<p>Persuading friends to switch to Signal is hard work, but if you try, you will notice how the data that those companies get from you will decrease.</p>
<p>You can check out some alternatives like <a href="https://simplex.chat/">SimpleX Chat</a>, <a href="https://briarproject.org/">Briar</a>, <a href="https://getsession.org/">Session</a>, and <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a>.</p>
<h2 id="password-manager">Password manager</h2>
<p>I strongly recommend that you use a password manager. It&rsquo;s again something about privacy and security. It can help you avoid using the same passwords for multiple platforms, which will reduce the chance of being hacked.</p>
<p>A password manager is good, but it&rsquo;s something about the company that developed that service. You should never use the built-in password manager in browsers; it&rsquo;s very easy to hack. The built-in password managers on Apple and Android devices are good, but they lack multi-platforms, which will lock you in their ecosystem.</p>
<p>I will recommend using <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>, it&rsquo;s free and open source. You can get their premium for only $10 a year.</p>
<p>Some alternatives like: <a href="https://proton.me/pass">ProtonPass</a>, and <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a>.</p>
<h2 id="operating-system">Operating System.</h2>
<p>You can create a new user account that doesn&rsquo;t have root permission.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://privacy.sexy/">privacy.sexy</a>, it&rsquo;ll help you turn off telemetry from the OS.</p>
<p>You can also create multiple user accounts for multiple purposes, just like with a web browser.</p>
<p>An online sync platform, a hard drive partition, or a USB will help you transfer files and data.</p>
<p>Linux is the best for privacy, but not all of them. You can check out the <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/desktop/">Desktop/PC article</a> and <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/os">Operating Systems</a> for more recommendations. Be aware of Ubuntu.</p>
<p>The operating systems you are using on your phone are mostly iOS or Android. You can check out Graphene OS. For iOS devices, you don&rsquo;t have too many choices, but you can have some configurations.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter which OS you&rsquo;re using; make sure that you have strong encryption on your device.</p>
<p>For an external drive, like a self-host cloud, USB, or hard disk, you can use built-in encryption or third-party software like <a href="https://veracrypt.eu/">VeraCrypt</a>.</p>
<h2 id="networking">Networking</h2>
<p>You can use VPNs from Cloudflare (red flag), Proton, Mullvad (the best).
It will prevent network administrators from looking for what you&rsquo;re doing by encrypting the data flow, creating a fake IP address, &hellip; But be cautious, because it will mark you as using a VPN.</p>
<p>Using cellular data is not a bad option if you can&rsquo;t use a VPN; it will not replace a VPN, but it will protect you from hackers. But the service provider will know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You can choose a DNS resolver from <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls">Mullvad</a> or <a href="https://www.quad9.net/support/set-up-guides">Quad9</a>.</p>
<p>For anything on the internet, you should stay away from Cloudflare. <a href="https://0xacab.org/dCF/deCloudflare">Here</a> is the reason. I&rsquo;ll guide you on how to reduce the amount of Cloudflare in soon.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>Using school software for school work and personal software for personal work only.</p>
<p>Instead of using Office 365, you can check out <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>.</p>
<p>For sync files, you can use encryption cloud storage from Proton, Tresorit, Filen, pCloud, IceDrive,&hellip; But for the most affordable, you can encrypt your files before uploading by using <a href="https://cryptomator.org/">Cryptomator</a>, 7-zip, <a href="https://rclone.org/">rclone</a>,&hellip;</p>
<p>You can also check FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) alternatives for every application you&rsquo;re using. And stay away from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html">proprietary software</a>.</p>
<p>For code development, you can check out <a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> to replace VSCode.</p>
<p>Maybe it will get a long blog for software only.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Anh Khoa, a second-year student majoring in Software Engineering at Ton Duc Thang University.</p>
<p>I am a fan of minimalism, stoicism, reading, programming, traveling, and adventure, and my philosophy of life is rooted in these principles. I strive to learn, grow, and improve in all aspects of my life, and I enjoy helping others and creating value for the community.</p>
<p>I believe that minimalism is a way of life that helps us focus on the most important things in life. It helps us to let go of the unnecessary and focus on what is truly important, such as time, health, and relationships. Stoicism is a philosophy of life that helps us to become stronger and overcome challenges. It teaches us how to accept what we cannot change and focus on what we can change.</p>
<p>I believe that reading is a great way to learn and expand our knowledge. It helps us to better understand the world around us and about ourselves. Programming is a great way to express our creativity. It helps us to create new and useful things. Traveling and adventure are a great way to experience new things and learn about different cultures.</p>
<p>I believe that we can all make a difference in the world. We can help others by giving our time, talent, and money. We can create value for the community by participating in volunteer activities and community projects.</p>
<p>I hope you find this website helpful. I will try to update it with new articles regularly. If you have any questions or feedback, please contact me.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting!</p>

<p>Do not use Cloudflare solution, Period.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can do better than that, right? <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167776-Removing-subscriptions-plans-domains-or-accounts">Here&rsquo;s how to remove Cloudflare subscriptions, plans, domains, or accounts.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want more customers? You know what to do. Hint is &ldquo;above line&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://it.slashdot.org/story/19/02/19/0033255/stop-saying-we-take-your-privacy-and-security-seriously">Hello, you wrote &ldquo;We take your privacy seriously&rdquo; but I got &ldquo;Error 403 Forbidden Anonymous Proxy Not Allowed&rdquo;.</a> Why are you blocking Tor Or VPN? And why are you blocking temporary emails?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Cloudflare will increase chances of an outage. Visitors can&rsquo;t access to your website if your server is down or Cloudflare is down.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/cloudflare-down-not-working-sites-producing-504-gateway-timeout-errors-2618008">Did you really think Cloudflare never go down?</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Cloudflare to proxy your &ldquo;API service&rdquo;, &ldquo;software update server&rdquo; or &ldquo;RSS feed&rdquo; will harm your customer. A customer called you and said &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t use your API anymore&rdquo;, and you have no idea what is going on. Cloudflare can silently block your customer. Do you think it is okay?</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many RSS reader client and RSS reader online service. Why are you publishing RSS feed if you&rsquo;re not allowing people to subscribe?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you need HTTPS certificate? Use &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Encrypt&rdquo; or just buy it from CA Company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you need DNS server? Can&rsquo;t set up your own server? How about them:</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a software engineering student, I love the beauty of tech, but I&rsquo;m also afraid of it.</p>
<p>Technologies help us a lot in every aspect of life. But it also brings a data hunger from big tech companies.</p>
<p>But there is always a solution. You can get more privacy, so big companies can&rsquo;t have information about you, or they have at least.</p>
<h2 id="web-browser">Web-browser</h2>
<p>You can opt out of Google Chrome by using <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://ungoogled-software.github.io/">Ungoogled-chromium</a>, I have a <a href="/blog/browsers-for-daily-using/">detailed review</a>.</p>
<p>You have to separate your activities. Creating multiple profiles for multiple purposes is a good idea.</p>
<h2 id="email">Email</h2>
<p>I know that a lot of universities give Gmail accounts to their students. It&rsquo;s an easy way for them.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t switch email services when using school email, but you can choose an alternative for personal purposes.</p>
<p>You can check out <a href="https://tuta.com/">Tuta</a>, <a href="https://proton.me/">Proton</a>, <a href="https://skiff.com/">Skiff</a>.
They have an easy way to register.</p>
<p>If you want to have PGP by yourself, I strongly recommend it. You may look at <a href="https://disroot.org/">Disroot</a>, <a href="https://cock.li/">Cock.li</a>, <a href="https://www.autistici.org/">Autistici</a>, or even G-Mail with <a href="https://mailvelope.com/">Mailvelope</a></p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://digdeeper.club/articles/email.xhtml">E-mail providers - which one to choose?</a> article from DigDeeper which can give you reviews and a lot of suggestions.</p>
<p>You have to notice that you <strong>never</strong> use school email for personal work, creating accounts,&hellip;
It&rsquo;s something about privacy and security:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some schools block emails outside the organization.</li>
<li>They can delete your email accounts when you leave the university.</li>
<li>An administrator can easily reset the password.</li>
<li>They can gain unauthorized access to your email account.</li>
</ol>
<p>But you can choose the <em><strong>TrustNoOne</strong></em> plan by encrypting your email manually using PGP. The software you can use is <a href="https://gnupg.org/">The GNU Privacy Guard</a>.</p>
<p>An email client would be nice: <a href="https://www.claws-mail.org/">Claws Mail</a>, <a href="https://neomutt.org/">NeoMutt</a>, and <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">ThunderBird</a> (which should be hardened for privacy concerns). Email clients will help you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the program you like. Not depending on the provider&rsquo;s JavaScript.</li>
<li>The mail client will remain constant. Prevent being served malicious JavaScript.</li>
<li>POP3 allows you to keep control of your data in your hands.</li>
<li>The variety of features.</li>
<li>Support PGP properly.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="real-time-messaging">Real-time messaging</h2>
<p>Although Facebook Messenger, Viber, and WhatsApp come with a lot of features. But they are data-hungers, no matter how encrypted they are.
Those encryptions can only protect you from attackers, not from those companies.</p>
<p>You can switch to <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>, it&rsquo;s an encrypted messaging platform that has a good reputation, doesn&rsquo;t store your messages, and is very easy to use.</p>
<p>Persuading friends to switch to Signal is hard work, but if you try, you will notice how the data that those companies get from you will decrease.</p>
<p>You can check out some alternatives like <a href="https://simplex.chat/">SimpleX Chat</a>, <a href="https://briarproject.org/">Briar</a>, <a href="https://getsession.org/">Session</a>, and <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a>.</p>
<h2 id="password-manager">Password manager</h2>
<p>I strongly recommend that you use a password manager. It&rsquo;s again something about privacy and security. It can help you avoid using the same passwords for multiple platforms, which will reduce the chance of being hacked.</p>
<p>A password manager is good, but it&rsquo;s something about the company that developed that service. You should never use the built-in password manager in browsers; it&rsquo;s very easy to hack. The built-in password managers on Apple and Android devices are good, but they lack multi-platforms, which will lock you in their ecosystem.</p>
<p>I will recommend using <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>, it&rsquo;s free and open source. You can get their premium for only $10 a year.</p>
<p>Some alternatives like: <a href="https://proton.me/pass">ProtonPass</a>, and <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a>.</p>
<h2 id="operating-system">Operating System.</h2>
<p>You can create a new user account that doesn&rsquo;t have root permission.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://privacy.sexy/">privacy.sexy</a>, it&rsquo;ll help you turn off telemetry from the OS.</p>
<p>You can also create multiple user accounts for multiple purposes, just like with a web browser.</p>
<p>An online sync platform, a hard drive partition, or a USB will help you transfer files and data.</p>
<p>Linux is the best for privacy, but not all of them. You can check out the <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/desktop/">Desktop/PC article</a> and <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/os">Operating Systems</a> for more recommendations. Be aware of Ubuntu.</p>
<p>The operating systems you are using on your phone are mostly iOS or Android. You can check out Graphene OS. For iOS devices, you don&rsquo;t have too many choices, but you can have some configurations.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter which OS you&rsquo;re using; make sure that you have strong encryption on your device.</p>
<p>For an external drive, like a self-host cloud, USB, or hard disk, you can use built-in encryption or third-party software like <a href="https://veracrypt.eu/">VeraCrypt</a>.</p>
<h2 id="networking">Networking</h2>
<p>You can use VPNs from Cloudflare (red flag), Proton, Mullvad (the best).
It will prevent network administrators from looking for what you&rsquo;re doing by encrypting the data flow, creating a fake IP address, &hellip; But be cautious, because it will mark you as using a VPN.</p>
<p>Using cellular data is not a bad option if you can&rsquo;t use a VPN; it will not replace a VPN, but it will protect you from hackers. But the service provider will know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You can choose a DNS resolver from <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls">Mullvad</a> or <a href="https://www.quad9.net/support/set-up-guides">Quad9</a>.</p>
<p>For anything on the internet, you should stay away from Cloudflare. <a href="https://0xacab.org/dCF/deCloudflare">Here</a> is the reason. I&rsquo;ll guide you on how to reduce the amount of Cloudflare in soon.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>Using school software for school work and personal software for personal work only.</p>
<p>Instead of using Office 365, you can check out <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>.</p>
<p>For sync files, you can use encryption cloud storage from Proton, Tresorit, Filen, pCloud, IceDrive,&hellip; But for the most affordable, you can encrypt your files before uploading by using <a href="https://cryptomator.org/">Cryptomator</a>, 7-zip, <a href="https://rclone.org/">rclone</a>,&hellip;</p>
<p>You can also check FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) alternatives for every application you&rsquo;re using. And stay away from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html">proprietary software</a>.</p>
<p>For code development, you can check out <a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> to replace VSCode.</p>
<p>Maybe it will get a long blog for software only.</p>
<p>For more information, you can check out: <a href="https://www.opensourcealternative.to/">Open Source Alternative To</a> Using <code>https://alternativeto.net/software/YOURPRODUCTNAME/?license=opensource</code></p>

</ul>
<p>From <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Comparison_of_browser_engines?lang=en">Wikipedia: Comparison of Browser Engines,</a> there are 4 browser engines that have <strong>active</strong> status: WebKit, Blink, Gecko, and Goanna. In this blog, I&rsquo;ll delve into the two most popular: <a href="#gecko-engine">Gecko (Firefox-based)</a> and <a href="#blink-engine">Blink (Chromium-based)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gecko-engine">Gecko Engine</h2>
<h3 id="firefox-but-hardened">Firefox, but hardened</h3>
<p>This is my first choice when it comes to a browser for privacy. I love the Firefox browser, but I don&rsquo;t really like the way Mozilla develops it.</p>
<p>You can download Firefox on <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Mozilla&rsquo;s website</a>. But I don&rsquo;t recommend it because of the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1677497#c0">download token</a>.</p>
<p>You can download it from <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/">Mozilla&rsquo;s FTP website</a>, by this way, you can choose any version of Firefox and download it without the token. You can decide whether the latest, extended support release, or EME-free version.</p>
<p>The default Mozilla Firefox will come with a large amount of telemetry and add-ons, which you don&rsquo;t really love to use.</p>
<p>For better privacy, you can config in <code>about:config</code> or use the <code>user.js</code> file, but it takes knowledge, time, and effort to review and make changes. So you will need a template to configure the browser.</p>
<p>There are three levels of hardening Firefox:</p>
<ol>
<li>Easy: <a href="https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox">Betterfox</a></li>
<li>Medium: <a href="https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js">arkenfox</a></li>
<li>Hard: <a href="https://codeberg.org/Narsil/user.js/src/branch/main/desktop">Narsil</a></li>
</ol>
<p>It depends on you to select which one is appropriate. Betterfox provides a slight change to Firefox, which doesn&rsquo;t affect the your experience too much.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Narsil provides the maximum privacy and security on Firefox, but it will change the way you use Firefox.</p>
<p>If you want balance, choose arkenfox, it&rsquo;s the gold standard for Firefox.</p>
<p>For comparison, you can use the PowerShell script <a href="https://github.com/claustromaniac/Compare-UserJS">Compare-UserJS</a> to pick the most appropriate for yourself.</p>
<p>And because they&rsquo;re templates, they are not fit for your use case. So you&rsquo;ll need a <code>user-overrides.js</code> to have your own modifications; you can check out the documentation for this one at <a href="https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/3.1-Overrides">the Arkenfox Wiki</a>.</p>
<h3 id="librewolf">LibreWolf</h3>
<p>Home page: <a href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a></p>
<p>Config file: <a href="https://codeberg.org/librewolf/settings/raw/branch/master/librewolf.cfg">librewolf.cfg</a></p>
<p>This project brings a mindless way to use Firefox without worrying about how to configure it. It looks like Ungoogled Chromium to Google Chrome.</p>
<p>But I have had some bad experiences when using it:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s not able to use 1Password biometrics because <a href="https://1password.community/discussion/comment/633723/#Comment_633723">it lacks a code signature</a>. But it can work well with Bitwarden or KeePassXC.</li>
<li>Lacking of auto-update capacities raises a concern about security and <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)?lang=en">zero-day vulnerability</a>. But it can be fixed by using packet manager or using <a href="https://codeberg.org/ltguillaume/librewolf-winupdater">LibreWolf WinUpdater</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So if you want a mindless way to use Firefox, don&rsquo;t use 1Password, and don&rsquo;t need a built-in updater, LibreWolf will be the best for you.</p>
<h3 id="mullvad-browser">Mullvad Browser</h3>
<p>Home page: <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/browser">Mullvad Browser</a></p>
<p>Modifications: <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/browser/hard-facts">Hard facts</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mullvad Browser is a collaboration between Mullvad VPN and the Tor Project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the new one; I have not tried it yet, but it makes 0 connections in the initial. This should be a strong competitor to LibreWolf, comes with strong privacy and anti-fingerprinting features.</p>
<p>It has 3 extensions built-in: uBlock Origin, NoScript, and Mullvad Browser Extension. It includes auto-updates and creating new identity features.</p>
<h2 id="blink-engine">Blink Engine</h2>
<h3 id="ungoogled-chromium">Ungoogled Chromium</h3>
<p>Home page: <a href="https://ungoogled-software.github.io/">ungoogled-chromium</a></p>
<p>Binary download: <a href="https://ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-binaries/">Latest versions</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lightweight approach to removing Google web service dependency</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is Chromium, so it will provide you with a bunch of extensions that will make your life easier.</p>
<p>It seems like this is the only browser based on chromiu, and I will recommend my friends use it. You just need to make some modifications, and it will work like Brave.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to install <a href="https://github.com/NeverDecaf/chromium-web-store">an extension</a> to be able to install extensions from the Chrome Web Store.</p>
<p>Here are some <code>chrome://flags</code> I use:</p>
<ul>
<li>#extension-mime-request-handling: <code>Always prompt for install</code></li>
<li>#chrome-labs: <code>Disabled</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="brave-browser">Brave Browser</h3>
<p>This is the most popular browser when you know the word <strong>privacy</strong>, and choose an alternative to Google Chrome.</p>
<p>But it has a lot of issues and features that make me don&rsquo;t want to use it anymore:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has 7 connections when you first install it.</li>
<li>They have sponsored ads on browsers.</li>
<li>Brave Rewards needs a KYC account to use it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I used the Brave browser, but I&rsquo;m not happy with it anymore. Anything it provides is just a cut-off of some extensions. And if you have an extension, it will do better.</p>
<p>However, anything is better than Chrome, and you can have <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/desktop-browsers/#recommended-configuration_1">some configurations</a> to make Brave more private.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, there is absolutely no such thing as the best browser for anything. It depends on you; it will only have a less bad browser. You can base your decision on my article; it is just something I gathered from the Internet. In my case, I&rsquo;ll recommend using <a href="#firefox-but-hardened">Firefox hardened</a> and <a href="#ungoogled-chromium">Ungoogled chromium</a> because they fit my needs. However, the ideal choice varies for each user, and the goal is to find a browser that meets their unique criteria.</p>

<p>After reading blogs and watching videos, I&rsquo;ve come to realize that email lacks inherent privacy and security features.
Even if you host a personal OpenBSD email server in an undisclosed nuclear bunker with a crypto domain connected to Tor, your emails still traverse ISP networks and reside on third-party servers.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s crucial to prioritize privacy and move away from mainstream providers like Google, achieving secure communication requires alternatives to traditional email protocols.
Signal, Matrix, and similar platforms offer better options for long-term privacy and security compared to standard email services like Gmail and Outlook.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to acknowledge that trusting any company, regardless of claims about zero trust, encryption, or adherence to privacy laws, carries risks.
Even with end-to-end encryption, companies can potentially compromise your security, making it essential to explore options beyond conventional email.</p>
<p>For enhanced privacy, consider using <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> or exploring alternatives.
However, always exercise caution and, if needed, encrypt your emails using PGP and mail client add-ons like Enigmail.
Remember, the cloud is essentially someone else&rsquo;s computer, emphasizing the need for personal responsibility in securing your communications.</p>
<p>In conclusion, don&rsquo;t blindly trust any email provider&rsquo;s assurances of robust encryption or privacy.
Consider employing Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) for email encryption or opt for messaging apps specifically designed for secure communication, such as Signal or Briar.</p>

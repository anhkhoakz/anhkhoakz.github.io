- Do not use Cloudflare solution, Period.
  - You can do better than that, right? [Here's how to remove Cloudflare subscriptions, plans, domains, or accounts.](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167776-Removing-subscriptions-plans-domains-or-accounts)


- Want more customers? You know what to do. Hint is "above line".
  - [Hello, you wrote "We take your privacy seriously" but I got "Error 403 Forbidden Anonymous Proxy Not Allowed".](https://it.slashdot.org/story/19/02/19/0033255/stop-saying-we-take-your-privacy-and-security-seriously) Why are you blocking Tor Or VPN? And why are you blocking temporary emails?


- Using Cloudflare will increase chances of an outage. Visitors can't access to your website if your server is down or Cloudflare is down.
  - [Did you really think Cloudflare never go down?](https://www.ibtimes.com/cloudflare-down-not-working-sites-producing-504-gateway-timeout-errors-2618008).


- Using Cloudflare to proxy your "API service", "software update server" or "RSS feed" will harm your customer. A customer called you and said "I can't use your API anymore", and you have no idea what is going on. Cloudflare can silently block your customer. Do you think it is okay?
  - There are many RSS reader client and RSS reader online service. Why are you publishing RSS feed if you're not allowing people to subscribe?


- Do you need HTTPS certificate? Use "Let's Encrypt" or just buy it from CA Company.
- Do you need DNS server? Can't set up your own server? How about them:

- Are you using "Cloudflare-ipfs.com"? [Do you know Cloudflare IPFS is bad?](../PEOPLE.md)
- Install Web Application Firewall such as OWASP and Fail2Ban on your server and configure it properly.
  - Blocking Tor is not a solution. Don't punish everyone just for small bad users.
- Redirect or block "Cloudflare Warp" users from accessing your website. And provide a reason if you can.

- Discord is using Cloudflare. Alternatives? We recommend [**Briar** (Android)](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.briarproject.briar.android/), [Ricochet (PC)](https://ricochet.im/), [Tox + Tor (Android/PC)](https://tox.chat/download.html)

  - Briar includes Tor daemon so you don't have to install Orbot.
  - Qwtch developers, Open Privacy, deleted stop_Cloudflare project from their git service without notice.
- If you use Debian GNU/Linux, or any derivative, subscribe: [bug #831835](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=831835). And if you can, help verify the patch, and help the maintainer come to the right conclusion on whether it should be accepted.
- Always recommend these browsers.

Other software's privacy is imperfect. This doesn't mean Tor browser is "perfect".
There is no 100% secure nor 100% private on the internet and technology.

- Don't want to use Tor? You can use any browser with Tor daemon.
  - [Note that the Tor project don't like this.](https://support.torproject.org/tbb/tbb-9/) Use Tor Browser if you are able to do so.

<summary><h3>Mozilla Firefox user</h3></summary>

- "Firefox Nightly" will send debug-level information to Mozilla servers without opt-out method.

  - [Mozilla servers are behing Cloudflare](https://www.digwebinterface.com/?hostnames=www.mozilla.org%0D%0Amozilla.Cloudflare-dns.com&type=&ns=resolver&useresolver=8.8.4.4&nameservers=)
- It is possible to prohibit Firefox to connect to Mozilla servers.

  - [Mozilla's policy-templates guide](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/blob/master/README.md)
  - Keep in mind this trick might stop working in later version because Mozilla likes to whitelist themselves.
  - Use firewall and DNS filter to block them completely.

"`/distribution/policies.json`"

```json
"WebsiteFilter": {
"Block": [
"*://*.mozilla.com/*",
"*://*.mozilla.net/*",
"*://*.mozilla.org/*",
"*://webcompat.com/*",
"*://*.firefox.com/*",
"*://*.thunderbird.net/*",

]
},
```

- ~~Report a bug on mozilla's tracker, telling them not to use Cloudflare.~~ There was a bug report on bugzilla. Many people were posted their concern, however the bug was hidden by the admin in 2018.
- You can disable DoH in Firefox.
  - [Change default DNS provider of firefox](../subfiles/change-firefox-dns.md)


- [If you would like to use non-ISP DNS, consider using OpenNIC Tier2 DNS service or any of non-Cloudflare DNS services.](https://wiki.opennic.org/start)
  - Block Cloudflare with DNS. [Crimeflare DNS](../subfiles/service/publicdns.md)
- You can use Tor as DNS resolver. [If you're not Tor expert, ask question here.](https://tor.stackexchange.com/)

**How?**

1. Download Tor and install it on your computer.
2. Add this line to "torrc" file.
   DNSPort 127.0.0.1:53
3. Restart Tor.
4. Set your computer's DNS server to "127.0.0.1".


<summary><h3>Action</h3></summary>

- Tell others around you about the dangers of Cloudflare.
- [Help improve this repository.](http://crimeflare.eu.org)
  - Both the lists, the arguments against it and the details.
- [Document and make very public where things go wrong with Cloudflare (and similar companies), making sure to mention this repository when you do so](http://crimeflare.eu.org) :)
- Get more people using Tor by default, so they can experience the web from the perspective of different parts of the world.
- Start groups, in social media and meatspace, dedicated to liberating the world from Cloudflare.
- Where appropriate, link to these groups on this repository - this can be a place for coordinating working together as groups.
- [Start a coop that can provide a meaningful non corporate alternative to Cloudflare.](../subfiles/alternative/cloudflare.md)
- Let us know of any alternatives to help at least provide multiple layered defence against Cloudflare.
- If you are a Cloudflare customer, set your privacy settings and wait for them to violate them.
  - [Then bring them under anti-spam/privacy violation charges.](https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1108424723233419264)
- If you are in the United States of America and the website in question is a bank or an accountant, try to bring legal pressure under the Grammâ€“Leachâ€“Bliley Act, or the Americans with Disabilities Act and report back to us how far you get.
- If the website is a government site, try to bring legal pressure under the 1st Amendment of the US Constitution.
- If you are EU citizen, contact the website to send your personal information under the General Data Protection Regulation. If they refuse to give you your information, that's a violation of the law.
- For companies that claim to offer service on their website try reporting them as "false advertising" to consumer protection organizations and BBB. Cloudflare websites are served by Cloudflare servers.
- [The ITU suggest in the US context that Cloudflare is starting to get big enough that antitrust law might be brought down upon them.](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Workshops-and-Seminars/20181218/Documents/Geoff_Huston_Presentation.pdf)
- It's conceivable that the GNU GPL version 4 could include a provision against storing source code behind such a service, requiring for all GPLv4 and later programs that at least the source code is accessible via a medium that does not discriminate against Tor users.

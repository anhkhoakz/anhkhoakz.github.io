# Password Manager

## Why you need a password manager?

In the beginning, we have to answer the question is that, why should we need a password manager?

In short, for your own security.

If you use the same password for both video streaming service and your bank, the attacker only needs to steal 1 password to access both of your accounts.
If you do the same for 50 accounts, 50 times your exposure.

## How can I avoid exposing my password?

Partially, You can't. It depends on both you and the services you use that password.
If you use a short, easy to guess password, it takes attacker from some seconds to minutes to crack your password.
If you choose a very strong password, you'll be exposed if the services you use don't have right methods to encrypt and store your password.

## How strong a password should be?

There are rules that you have to consider:

| Aspect| Old Rules| New Rules|
|-------|----------|----------|
| Password Formula| Mix of upper and lower case, numbers, special characters, etc. | Focus on length for strength.|
| Password Expiry| Change every 6 or 12 months.| No frequent changes; only when necessary. |
| Password Hint| Provide a hint.| No hints provided.|
| Secret Questions| Use for password reset.| No secret questions used.|

So a good password is a password have a well length, no change, and no hints. So how can I have a password like that? How can I remember them? How can I not reuse them? And how to make it easier to login in an account? It is a time for password manager.

## What is password manager?

A password manager is a tool that creates and stores unique passwords for you, so you can use many passwords on different sites and services without having to memorize them.
Password managers are tools that can:

- Generate strong passwords that a human being would be unlikely to guess.
- Store several passwords (and responses to security questions) safely.
- Protect your passwords with a single master password (or passphrase).
- Sync passwords between your devices, so you can access these complex passwords from anywhere (optional).

## Why you need it?

Because generating a strong password is a time-consuming and remember them is not really practical. A password manager will resolve all the human weakness.

## How is it secure?

It depends on which password manager you use. I think a good password manager should be:

- AES-256 bit encryption
- End-to-end encryption
- Privacy
- Security features
- Multi-factor authentication
- Good reputation
- Cross-platforms
- Open-source
- Audited
- Free (optional)
- Cloud (optional)

# Rust-based

High performance comparable to that of C and C++ is offered by Rust, which also guarantees memory safety and guards against common bugs and security flaws.

Versatility: Rust has a broad range of uses, including data analysis, artificial intelligence, and web development.

Cross-platform compatibility: Windows, macOS, and Linux are just a few of the platforms that Rust works with.

Active community: Rust fans encourage the language's advancement and consistently add new frameworks and libraries.

Adoption by large firms: Rust is being utilized more frequently in important and well-known projects thanks to support from large tech companies, which further validates its dependability and capabilities.

# Privacy focused

Your privacy has never been more important in the current era of digital data exploitation, but many people think it is already hopeless. It's not. You must be concerned about your privacy since it is at risk. Power is what privacy is all about, and it is crucial that this power is in the proper hands.

In the end, privacy is about human information, which is significant since we know that human knowledge gives people power. The laws governing information about us must be important to us if we want to be genuine, contented, and free humans. Information is the foundation of so much of our contemporary culture. You rely on information when you vote, purchase online, read the news, look something up, ask for directions, and pretty much do anything else. In an information-based culture, privacy is important since our information is important.

# Secure

Not much to say, which software you would like to use if it is not secure?

# Lightweight

As above, not much to say, who would like to use a software that consumes a lot of resources? But if you want me to give you a **why**, here you go:

Resource Efficiency: Less CPU, memory (RAM), and storage are used by lightweight software. In order to ensure that the software operates without creating performance bottlenecks, this is especially crucial for devices with constrained hardware capabilities.

Faster Performance: Lightweight software can launch and operate more quickly by using less code and dependencies. Applications that must process data or react swiftly to user inputs
must do this.

Usability: Software that is lightweight is typically simpler and easier to operate. Because it frequently has fewer functionality, users—especially those who are not tech-savvy—may find it easier to use.

Resource Efficiency: Lightweight software uses less CPU, memory (RAM), and storage. This is particularly important for devices with limited hardware capabilities to make sure the software runs without causing performance bottlenecks.

Faster Performance: By utilizing fewer code and dependencies, lightweight software can start and run faster. This is necessary for applications that need to process data or respond quickly to user interaction.

Usability: Lightweight software is usually simpler and easier to use. Users, particularly those who are not tech-savvy, may find it easier to use because it usually has fewer features.

Portability: Small embedded systems and big servers can both execute lightweight software, which is frequently more portable. In the varied computer environments of today, this adaptability is essential.

Maintenance: Generally speaking, lightweight software needs less upgrades and maintenance. The overall maintenance burden is decreased because there are fewer features and dependencies, which means that fewer parts are susceptible to malfunction or require updating.

Cost-Effectiveness: It may be less expensive to create and maintain lightweight software. It frequently necessitates less time and resources for development, which might result in lesser expenses for the developer and the final consumer.

# Open Source

> Free software means that the software's users have freedom. (The issue is not about price.) We developed the GNU operating system so that users can have freedom in their computing.

Community Collaboration: Open source projects can benefit from contributions by a wider community. This can lead to faster development, bug fixes, and feature enhancements that a single developer or small team might not achieve alone.

Transparency and Trust: Open sourcing software allows users to inspect the code for security vulnerabilities, ensuring that there are no hidden malicious features. This transparency can build trust with users.

Learning and Skill Development: Developers often open source their projects to share knowledge and learn from others. This can help improve their coding skills and gain experience in working with a community.

Reputation and Portfolio: Contributing to or maintaining open source projects can enhance a developer's reputation in the tech community. It serves as a portfolio piece that showcases their skills to potential employers or clients.

Monetization Opportunities: Some developers open source their software to create a user base, which can later be monetized through services like support, consulting, or dual licensing.

Philosophical Beliefs: Many developers believe in the principles of open source, such as promoting freedom, sharing knowledge, and fostering innovation. They may feel a moral obligation to make their work available to others.

Avoiding Vendor Lock-in: By open sourcing their software, developers can help users avoid reliance on a single vendor. This can be particularly appealing in enterprise environments.

Long-term Sustainability: Open source projects can outlive their original creators if the community takes over maintenance. This can ensure that the software continues to be available and useful over time.

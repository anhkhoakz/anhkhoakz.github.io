First, I'd like you to read this article: [Until You Have Productivity Skills, Productivity Tools Are Useless](https://hbr.org/2016/08/until-you-have-productivity-skills-productivity-tools-are-useless). You don't have to try to learn a new productivity tools, but you need to have your own productivity skills first.

I will share my productivity workflows, it works for me, but it may not work for you. You can try it, and adjust it to fit your needs.

So next, I will talk about my daily routines:

## Daily routine

### During the day

With every tasks I put it into Things 3 [inbox](things:///show?id=inbox).
I've set appropriate reminders for Strides and when the reminder comes, I will do that habit. The less amount of time between cue, action, and reward, the more strong how habit is.

## Morning

I wake up at 6 AM and check in my yesterday habits. I look at the list of habits in the morning, and review today todo list.

## Afternoon

I go to the gym with [Strong](https://www.strong.app/) app to track my workout and find the next goal which appropriate for my condition.
I go to the park which in front of my home, or I go to the library at my university to read a book, learn language on Duolingo and practice English speaking.

## Evening

I plan my day with Structured and try to finish all of [Today list](things:///show?id=today) in Things. I review my day with Obsidian. I review my inbox list and find an appropriate time for those tasks.
I track my daily expense with [MoneyLover](https://moneylover.me/)

## Weekly routines

I will spend an amount of money to investing, using [DCA strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging) to invest consistently, I don't want to spend my time with trading because [You Suck at Investing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbUkmysgXFs).
I spend for about 30 minutes to review my last week expense, how good are my habits perform, and how many tasks I've done. I can do it easily with Python and some scripts.

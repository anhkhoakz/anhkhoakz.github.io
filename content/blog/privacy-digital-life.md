## Operating System

Anything, but please avoid ChromeOS, there is no way to achieve privacy within
this operating system.

### MacOS

- **Apple ID**: You can bypass the prompt to sign in to Apple ID, but it
prevents you from using AppStore, iTunes, and iCloud,... It is NOT required to
download & install system update, and install apps from outside the AppStore.

- **FileVault**: This step is to apply full-disk encryption to your MacBook.
You can keep the recovery key on iCloud, or let device display 24-digit which
you will copy it, store on encrypted container.

- **AntiVirus**: I personally don't use AntiVirus, but I'm not against it.

- **HomeBrew**: You can install homebrew follow instructions on their
[website](https://brew.sh/). After that, enter this commands:
`brew analytics off`

- **AntiMalware**: I recommend you to use
[KnockKnock](https://objective-see.org/products/knockknock.html)
to scan your MacBook for malware.

- **Firewall**: I recommend you to use
[LuLu](https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html)

- **Camera & Microphone**: I recommend you to use
[OverSight](https://objective-see.org/products/oversight.html)

- **Verify the structure of the system files**: You can use
[Onyx](https://www.titanium-software.fr/en/onyx.html)

### Windows

- Windows Defender: I recommend you to use Windows Defender which is
pre-installed on Windows.

- Please don't use [CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/), you can use
[BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org/) instead.

- Disable Telemetry: You can disable telemetry by using
[O&O ShutUp10](https://oo-software.com/en/)

- Uninstall software: Using
[Bulk Crap Uninstaller](https://www.bcuninstaller.com/).

## Password

You can check if you're vulnerable to password leakage by using
[HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).

I recommend you to use for online is [1Password](https://1password.com/),
[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), and if you prefer offline, you can use
[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/). I strongly discourage you to use
[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/).

You only need to remember one password, which is your master password. And all
other passwords should be generated by using built-in password generator, which
is strong and unique.

- [bitwarden/server](https://github.com/bitwarden/server)

## Two-Factor Authentication

For the best case, you should use hardware token, such as Yubikey, Nitrokey,...

If it is not possible, you can use software token, such as built-in password
manager, Ente Auth, Aegis Authenticator.

You shouldn't use SMS, Google Authenticator, Authy,...

This is an extra-step to protect your account from being hacked if your
password is compromised.

A modern authentication is Passkeys, which is a combination of password and
fingerprint.

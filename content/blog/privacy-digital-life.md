## Operating System

Anything, but please avoid ChromeOS, there is no way to achieve privacy within
this operating system.

### MacOS

- **Apple ID**: You can bypass the prompt to sign in to Apple ID, but it
  prevents you from using AppStore, iTunes, and iCloud,... It is NOT required to
  download & install system update, and install apps from outside the AppStore.

- **FileVault**: This step is to apply full-disk encryption to your MacBook.
  You can keep the recovery key on iCloud, or let device display 24-digit which
  you will copy it, store on encrypted container.

- **AntiVirus**: I personally don't use AntiVirus, but I'm not against it.

- **HomeBrew**: You can install homebrew follow instructions on their
  [website](https://brew.sh/). After that, enter this commands:
  `brew analytics off`

- **AntiMalware**: I recommend you to use
  [KnockKnock](https://objective-see.org/products/knockknock.html)
  to scan your MacBook for malware.

After install, allow their permissions and "Start Scan". If you see anything
process that you don't want it to run, just move it to Trash or rename it.

- **Firewall**: I recommend you to use
  [LuLu](https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html)

The built-in firewall of MacOS only block incomming connections, it's good, but
it will not conver all cases.

Each time your applications which make an outgoing connections, it will prompt
you like this image.

You will manually choose if it should connect to network. For example: You
install a calculator and LuLu prompt you to allow outgoing connections? That's
weird.

- **Camera & Microphone**: I recommend you to use
  [OverSight](https://objective-see.org/products/oversight.html)

This app is simple, each time an app use your camera or microphone, it will
prompt you like this image.

You can have options to allow or block it. Which I think pretty useful for
online meeting too.

- **Verify the structure of the system files**: You can use
  [Onyx](https://www.titanium-software.fr/en/onyx.html)

### Windows

- Windows Defender: I recommend you to use Windows Defender which is
  pre-installed on Windows.

- Please don't use [CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/), you can use
  [BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org/) instead.

- Disable Telemetry: You can disable telemetry by using
  [O&O ShutUp10](https://oo-software.com/en/)

- Uninstall software: Using
  [Bulk Crap Uninstaller](https://www.bcuninstaller.com/).

## Password

You can check if you're vulnerable to password leakage by using
[HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).

I recommend you to use for online is [1Password](https://1password.com/),
[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), and if you prefer offline, you can use
[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/). I strongly discourage you to use
[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/).

You only need to remember one password, which is your master password. And all
other passwords should be generated by using built-in password generator, which
is strong and unique.

For reading & Source code:

- [SP 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html)
- [keepassxreboot/keepassxc](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc)
- [bitwarden/server](https://github.com/bitwarden/server)

## Two-Factor Authentication

For the best case, you should use hardware token, such as Yubikey, Nitrokey,...

If it is not possible, you can use software token, such as built-in password
manager, Ente Auth, Aegis Authenticator.

You shouldn't use SMS, Google Authenticator, Authy,...

This is an extra-step to protect your account from being hacked if your
password is compromised.

A modern authentication is Passkeys, which is a combination of password and
fingerprint.

## Browser

By default, MacOS has Safari, and Windows has Edge. But seriously, you
shouldn't use them.

I recommend you to use Firefox, and follow my instruction from
[How I Configure Firefox]({{< relref "how-i-configure-firefox.md" >}}).

Forks of Firefox: [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/),
[Mullvad Browser](https://mullvad.net/en/browser)

Another option is [Brave](https://brave.com/). But it comes with a lot of
cryptocurrency-things, so you have to modified it a lot.

Forks of Chrome:
[ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium)

### Extensions

- [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix)
- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) (less features than
  uMatrix but easy to use)
- Filter lists:
     - You need to read each filter list carefully, and you should know what it
       does.
     - Recommended: [DandelionSprout/LegitimateURLShortener](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt)
- [Decentraleyes](https://git.synz.io/Synzvato/decentraleyes)

## DNS

I will recommend you some DNS servers:

- [Cloudflare](https://1.1.1.1/)
- [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls)
- [AdGuard](https://adguard-dns.io/en/public-dns.html)

## Email

Please avoid using Gmail.

Some name of providers:

- [Disroot](https://disroot.org)
- [Autistici](https://www.autistici.org)
- [Cork.li](https://cock.li/)
- [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail)
- [Tuta](https://tuta.com)

I have a big question mark on ProtonMail, and Tuta, because those don't allow
you to use your own email client, which is potientially inject a JavaScript to
steal your credentials.

For existing emails, you can use [Mailvelope](https://mailvelope.com) or set
a forwarding email.

For masking emails, I currenly use [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io), or you
can choose [AnonAddy](https://addy.io)

## Communication

Just use [Signal](https://signal.org), [Telegram](https://telegram.org) is
considered as a popular one, but I'm not sure if it is really safe.

## File sharing

You can use [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) or [Send](https://send.vis.ee/),
another instance of Send is [SkySend](https://ch.skysend.ch/).

## Note taking

You can use [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com/) or
[Notesnook](https://notesnook.com/)

# Email

## Gmail
It was a time when I know that how to create an email, and in my mind, email have to be Gmail. Because everybody use it.
But everything had changed since I know that Google is not a privacy company.

I've conducted a thorough review, and despite some positives like mail client support, Gmail has its drawbacks. 
While it's free, the cost is your data privacy. 
Gmail collects extensive information, including unique identifiers, device details, and interaction data. 
This constant tracking, coupled with the requirement for a Google account across their services, poses privacy concerns. Google's association with PRISM raises further apprehensions about data sharing with law enforcement. 
Using Gmail means supporting their controversial practices, so it's worth considering alternative providers that focus solely on email services and avoid contributing to Google's extensive data collection and influence.

Gmail is run by Google and was specifically named as part of the PRISM spying program. 
There is no way to use the web client without running nonfree JavaScript.

## Proton Mail
Expensive, honeypot

ProtonMail, often touted as a private email provider, raises several concerns upon closer examination. 
The sign-up process, especially for those using TOR or a VPN, requires SMS confirmation, contradicting their claim of not needing personally identifiable information. 
The "end-to-end" encryption has been criticized for generating encryption keys during sign-up and limitations in sharing encrypted messages with non-ProtonMail users.

Privacy-wise, ProtonMail stores extensive email metadata and website analytics data, including IP addresses and user activity.
Data retention policies reveal indefinite storage of active accounts and a 14-day retention of deleted data, posing potential privacy risks. 
ProtonMail's cooperation with government data requests, despite claims of requiring a Swiss court order, is also highlighted in its transparency reports.

Updates to their privacy policy and the introduction of dark patterns in the interface add to the skepticism surrounding ProtonMail. 
The pricing of their Mail Plus plan is criticized for being comparatively high, especially considering the limitations of the free plan. 
These factors, coupled with potential security issues, lead to reservations about ProtonMail's suitability for privacy-conscious users.

JavaScript needed to register or use system.
## Skiff
Terrible register, javascript

I'm eager for some action, armed with my chainsaw to cut down another problematic provider. 
Skiff, unfortunately, is Cloudflared, compromising security, as even the sign up page is affected. 
The registration process involves a malicious hCaptcha, contributing to the data labeling market. 
This means users essentially become lab rats, labeling data for machine learning.

Skiff's compatibility issues extend to browsers, and it lacks support for mail clients, limiting features and pushing users towards paid plans. 
Their end-to-end encryption raises concerns, especially considering potential compromises through JavaScript. 
The Terms of Service and privacy policies indicate broad data collection and potential sharing in mergers or acquisitions. 
In essence, Skiff's practices seem intrusive and raise questions about user privacy.

## Cloudflare

1. **Privacy Issues:** It raises concerns about Cloudflare's access to user data, including decrypted information and the potential for compromising user privacy.

2. **Censorship and Blocking:** The text discusses instances where Cloudflare is accused of blocking legitimate users, including Tor and VPN users, and how this may impact accessibility to websites.

3. **Network Reliability:** There are mentions of Cloudflare outages and the impact on websites, questioning the reliability and uptime of Cloudflare's services.

4. **Security and Encryption:** It questions the end-to-end encryption of Cloudflare's HTTPS and suggests that user data may not be as secure as implied.

5. **Potential Collaboration with Authorities:** The content suggests that Cloudflare's cooperation with government agencies, like the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, might raise concerns about data sharing and surveillance.

6. **Alternative Solutions:** The text encourages users to consider alternatives to Cloudflare and advocates for decentralizing the internet.

# About me

Hi everyone,

My name is Anh Khoa, a second-year student majoring in Software Engineering at Ton Duc Thang University.

I am a fan of minimalism, stoicism, reading, programming, traveling, and adventure, and my philosophy of life is rooted in these principles. I strive to learn, grow, and improve in all aspects of my life, and I enjoy helping others and creating value for the community.

I believe that minimalism is a way of life that helps us focus on the most important things in life. It helps us to let go of the unnecessary and focus on what is truly important, such as time, health, and relationships. Stoicism is a philosophy of life that helps us to become stronger and overcome challenges. It teaches us how to accept what we cannot change and focus on what we can change.

I believe that reading is a great way to learn and expand our knowledge. It helps us to better understand the world around us and about ourselves. Programming is a great way to express our creativity. It helps us to create new and useful things. Traveling and adventure are a great way to experience new things and learn about different cultures.

I believe that we can all make a difference in the world. We can help others by giving our time, talent, and money. We can create value for the community by participating in volunteer activities and community projects.

I hope you find this website helpful. I will try to update it with new articles regularly. If you have any questions or feedback, please contact me.

Thank you for visiting!

## About me

{{< figure src="images/avatar.webp" alt="anhkhoakz.dev"  width=auto height=500 class="rounded" loading="lazy" >}}

Hello everyone!

My name is Anh Khoa, and I’m a junior student studying Software Engineering at [Ton Duc Thang University](https://tdtu.edu.vn/).

I’m a big fan of minimalism, stoicism, reading, programming, traveling, and adventure. My life philosophy is based on these principles. I’m always learning, growing, and improving in all areas of my life. I love helping others and creating value for the community.

I think minimalism is a great way to focus on the most important things in life. It helps us let go of the unnecessary and focus on what really matters, like time, health, and relationships. Stoicism is a philosophy that helps us become stronger and overcome challenges. It teaches us to accept what we can’t change and focus on what we can.

I believe reading is a fantastic way to learn and expand our knowledge. It helps us understand the world better and about ourselves. Programming is a great way to express our creativity. It helps us create new and useful things. Traveling and adventure are a great way to experience new things and learn about different cultures.

I think we can all make a difference in the world. We can help others by giving our time, talent, and money. We can create value for the community by participating in volunteer activities and community projects.

I hope you find this website helpful. I’ll try to keep it updated with new articles regularly. If you have any questions or feedback, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Thanks for visiting!

## About this website

This site draws inspiration from [BearBlog](https://bearblog.dev/), [MidNight](https://midnight.pub/), and [Best Motherf\*cking website](https://bestmotherfucking.website/). It is constructed using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and features the [Bear Cub](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-bearcub/) theme.

### Why is it so basic?

You can look at [Best Motherf\*cking website](https://bestmotherfucking.website/) for the reasons, I love them, here is keypoints:

1. **Performance and Accessibility**: Websites have to load rapidly, work with all browsers and devices, and be simple to read.
2. **Design Errors**: Usability is hampered by extremely intricate designs and low contrast typography.
3. **Font**: It is considered antiquated and inefficient to load huge distant fonts.

For **simpler phrase**: This website can load with any network conditions, or any devices.
